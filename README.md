# BATTLESHIP

Welcome to our terminal-based Battleship game! 🚢

Specify your board size, create custom ships, place your ships on the board, and play against the computer in this Ruby (v. 2.7.2) adaptation of the classic board game.

We created this game as a paired project assignment in the first Module of Turing School of Software and Design.

## HOW TO PLAY 🧑‍💻

[Install Ruby!](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

Then run the Battleship Runner file in your terminal with the command:

`ruby battleship_runner.rb`

Then follow the prompts!
